## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
<!-- Hi, why are you looking at the source for this? :D -->
<!-- There's really nothing interesting back here -->
Hello, I'm Joshua Sing. I am a Software Engineer from Victoria, Australia ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º.  
I spend most of my spare time working on projects for a small group called [Hypera Development](https://github.com/HyperaDev/), in an attempt to create something that will make other people's lives easier.


### My experience

I have four years of experience with Java, one year with Go, and two years with TypeScript and React (and JavaScript/ES6).  
I am currently learning C, Rust<!-- help, what is this syntax... -->, Swift and Elixir.

I am a native English speaker, learning æ—¥æœ¬èªž (Japanese).
