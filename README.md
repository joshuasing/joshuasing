## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

<!-- Hi, did you think there would be something secret hiding in the source for this? -->
<!-- There is nothing other than markdown back here. -->

Hi, I'm Joshua Sing. I am a Software Engineer from Victoria, Australia ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º.  
I spend most of my free time working on projects for a small group called [Hypera Development](https://github.com/HyperaDev/), in an attempt to create something that will make people's lives easier.

### My experience

I have five years of experience with Java, two years with Go, and three years with TypeScript and React (and JavaScript/ES6).  
I am currently learning C, Rust and Elixir.

I am a native English speaker, learning æ—¥æœ¬èªž (Japanese).
